# 🌌 AI Tools Hub: Technical Manifest

> **Status**: Operational | **Environment**: Hybrid-Data Architecture | **Focus**: Frontier & Local AI Scaling

Welcome to the technical satellite for the **AI Tools Hub**. This repository serves as the blueprint and entry point for enthusiasts and developers monitoring the rapid evolution of the AI landscape in 2026.

## 🛠 Core Architecture

Our platform is built with a focus on **Data Integrity** and **Actionable Metrics**:

- **Frontier Tracking**: Real-time sentiment analysis and API performance metrics for GPT-5.2, Claude 4.5, and DeepSeek V3.2.
- **Local AI Scale**: Automated hardware recommendation engine based on TDP (Thermal Design Power) and VRAM requirements for models like Flux 2.
- **Sentiment Engine**: 3-layer investigation protocol (Official Docs, Legacy Media, & Reddit/X sentiment analysis).

## 🚀 Key Project Components

| Component | Technical Focus | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hardware Builder** | TDP-based PSU sizing & GPU-VRAM mapping | `STABLE` |
| **Nerf Tracker** | Intelligence degradation (Lobotomization) monitoring | `ACTIVE` |
| **Model Radar** | 6-axis performance comparison (Speed, Cost, Reasoning...) | `LIVE` |

### 🧠 Developer Note
*"We don't just list tools; we audit the intelligence. In an era of black-box updates and 'silent nerfs', data-driven skepticism is our primary filter."*
